[2025-07-21 16:42:51] Okay here we go so this will be another test this time I'm going to be doing it concurrently so I'm going to scroll through the reels for about five minutes get some audio
[2025-07-21 16:43:01] then I'll make like a little date and time thing where I'll be talking about like I'm going to be going on this event at this date.
[2025-07-21 16:43:12] if it can pick it up and then I will not pause the audio transcriber and still run the the the whole process with the chat gbt thing see if
[2025-07-21 16:43:22] If it works, that's great. I'll move on to the calendar and stuff like that. We're talking about immigration. Don't worry. You can come back. I hope so. Right now you're doing...
[2025-07-21 16:43:32] Making the case that he's not pro-crime. I just got a round of applause. I probably get another one
[2025-07-21 16:43:43] So you want me to remove my socks? Fun fact, the plot of Call of Duty Black Ops 2 is-
[2025-07-21 16:43:53] True the video game was released in 2012 but the storyline took place in 2025 where a cyber attack on the chinese stock exchange led to china banning the export of rare earth
[2025-07-21 16:44:04] Which leads to a global cold war. The game's storyline was developed in partnership with future warfare expert Peter Singer and retired Lieutenant Colonel Oliver North. And a lot of people...
[2025-07-21 16:44:14] Took this storyline super seriously one article called it scarily similar to wargame exercises run by the US military
[2025-07-21 16:44:25] Okay.
[2025-07-21 16:44:35] And here's what in. Programmed to analyze market conditions across major futures contracts like CL, NQ, and GC. It searches for high probability setups with strong risk to reward ratios.
[2025-07-21 16:44:46] Only taking trades with the highest chance of success. It's already generated over $270,000 in profits since January 2024, delivering a 71% win rate of $668,000.
[2025-07-21 16:44:56] It has literally turned $100,000 into over $370,000. That's a 270% return in just 16 months. The best part is that it's completely hands-free. And your money stays in your own...
[2025-07-21 16:45:07] Drinking games, but I made them one anyways. Today's game, the highly requested Clash Royale. Nobody needed this, but you will thank me for making it anyways. For this, we have our casual rules, and then we have some-
[2025-07-21 16:45:17] rules for the fellas that want to feel something after getting three crowns three times in a row Tools for the casual mode every tower you lose you take a set if you somehow win the match you're saying hydro
[2025-07-21 16:45:28] New costume for real, the red speedos aren't striking fear in me. And it says, Bell's all around. When are people going to understand that Superman is not-
[2025-07-21 16:45:38] The reason his suit doesn't strike fear is because he's not trying to Superman is the physical Representation of good he is the symbol of hope
[2025-07-21 16:45:49] The guy who rescues people's cats from trees. By the way, I know Batman is also a symbol of hope. Speaking of Batman, Superman literally inspired him to start wearing the brighter colors with the colors of hope.
[2025-07-21 16:45:59] If you realized his darker look was scaring civilians and more specifically children. No, no, no, what makes Superman scary to villains is the fact that he's just a good guy.
[2025-07-21 16:46:10] Think of it. There's really nothing motivating him to, you know, be a good guy. If he wanted to, he could just, like, kill everybody, you know, just be the bad guy. I know Superman is a good guy, ju- ju-
[2025-07-21 16:46:20] I mean, this is evidently gonna be a major conflict in the Superman movie. In the new trailer, we saw Lois ripping into Superman, asking why did he end the war with Baratheon?
[2025-07-21 16:46:31] It's like because that's the right thing to do. She's like, but why you know people just can't understand that superman is All right
[2025-07-21 16:46:41] I think that's enough, I'll also talk about like uh, oh yeah, on the 23rd I'll be going over to my sister's place in Santa Barbara, we're gonna be
[2025-07-21 16:46:52] beach and I'm gonna be doing some hikes and stuff and then I'll be coming back on the 27th at 7 p.m. When are you leaving? Oh I'm gonna be leaving
[2025-07-21 16:47:02] 12 at noon. I'm going to be leaving at 12 to Santa Barbara and then I'm going to be coming back around 7 p.m. 8 p.m. And I'll be back at 12.
[2025-07-21 16:47:13] Like around that time, so I think it'll be pretty cool. It's gonna be pretty hot But I think if I bring like a backpack and you know some hats and stuff
[2025-07-21 16:47:23] Fine. Alright, now I'm going to add some more words and stuff to hide it a little bit.
[2025-07-21 16:47:44] So my mom calls me today and she's like your cousin's getting married but the wedding's in France. I don't know why they're doing it there. It's such an expensive trip. Nobody's gonna go.
[2025-07-21 16:47:55] That's exactly why they're doing it. The only reason you plan a destination wedding is so that people don't go and it's just a fun vacation for you. Also, you say...
[2025-07-21 16:48:05] from the people that don't come that it pays for the trip by itself. I mean it makes sense why would you use your hard-earned cash so Uncle Jack can get trashed at a VFW in Texas when you
[2025-07-21 16:48:16] Beach in Tahiti and when your family invariably gets mad at you for doing this, that's when you play the victim and be like, oh, I'm sorry, I wanted my special day to be special.
[2025-07-21 16:48:26] beautiful opportunity to go on an adventure with the people I love the most, but clearly you don't care about me as much as I do.
[2025-07-21 16:48:37] So my mom calls me today and she's like your cousin's getting married but the wedding's in France I don't know why they're doing it there it's such an expensive trip nobody's gonna go I'm like
[2025-07-21 16:48:47] That's why they're doing it. The only reason you plan a destination wedding is so that people don't go and it's just a fun vacation for you. Also, you save so much money for...
[2025-07-21 16:48:58] Don't come that it pays for the trip by itself. I mean it makes sense Why would you use your hard-earned cash so uncle Jack can get trashed at a VFW in Texas when you could be tanked on a B
--------------------
[2025-07-21 16:49:08] And when your family invariably gets mad at you for doing this, that's when you play the victim and be like, oh, I'm sorry, I wanted my special day to do calculus.
[2025-07-21 16:49:19] What you groove. That is the question. Leonard Omi. Would you... Are you talking about my partner? Oh, you love Jess.
[2025-07-21 16:49:29] Pardon or not, your girlfriend, she's not better than you. What? Look at me. I'm better than you. Drink it.
[2025-07-21 16:49:40] Are you in love with my partner or are you in love with Jess? What did you call your partner or not? Your girlfriend. Something better than that. What? What?
[2025-07-21 16:49:50] I'm better than you.
[2025-07-21 16:50:01] that's so garage pissed
[2025-07-21 16:50:11] Thank you.
[2025-07-21 16:50:22] wallet for sign there's a line through it excuse me that's a piece of shit that they won't let you be french anymore
[2025-07-21 16:50:43] sign as a line
[2025-07-21 16:50:53] Have you ever met a French person? I just found out that my ancestors were...
[2025-07-21 16:51:04] and then just line through it. Continue.
[2025-07-21 16:51:14] Conquest game.
[2025-07-21 16:51:35] Six board spaces instead of the traditional 40. The game also only has one die, so you cannot physically roll a double So the game can only move as slowly as possible
[2025-07-21 16:51:46] What looks like?
[2025-07-21 16:51:56] You can put it in a non-sensuous nightmarish exclusive, which makes sense to me that a non-sensuous nightmare like this would only be sold at the listen.
[2025-07-21 16:52:07] The endless gaming, I guess. You're not gonna believe what I've summed up upon. According to Steam's rating and review system, the highest rated game for the past 14 years was...
[2025-07-21 16:52:17] which is an amazing game, you know, it was made by the company who runs the service where they sell the games I think like, not saying that it's intentional, but there's some vested interest
--------------------
[2025-07-21 16:57:45] Okay, so here we go. We have a new transcriber. I just realized it could be that we're running
[2025-07-21 16:57:55] the thread for too long, and that could be destroying it slowly. Um, like
[2025-07-21 16:58:06] Bermuddle can't handle too many words or like too long of a thing, but the thing is it should be doing it in like batches, so I don't know.
[2025-07-21 16:58:16] up with that. So yeah, we will see. We'll see what's going on.
[2025-07-21 16:58:27] is a better option. Now let me check how much it cost to run that test. So I did 7. Now it should be 9.
[2025-07-21 16:58:37] 10 requests. So it cost me a penny to run that test. There were 6,000, 7,000 tokens used. Okay.
[2025-07-21 16:58:48] tests. That's what I learned. I'm gonna run shorter tests and uh... Okay, so I'm planning on going to a birthday party
[2025-07-21 16:58:58] 23rd It's gonna be at 12 p.m. We're gonna be playing laser tag at New Work mall and
[2025-07-21 16:59:09] It's gonna end around 6 7 p.m. And then we're gonna head back home I'm gonna be attending Don and spirit that done
[2025-07-21 16:59:19] And it's gonna be pretty fun. Yeah. Also, this guy's blue
--------------------
[2025-07-21 16:59:30] And water is wet. All right, let me try. Let me try running that function testing. Hopefully it doesn't run the.
[2025-07-21 16:59:40] Do the thing. Boom boom boom boom. Uh.
[2025-07-21 16:59:51] Oh, never mind. It changed.
[2025-07-21 17:00:01] Oh my god, that's because... Okay.
[2025-07-21 17:00:12] I accidentally sent it to the entire transcript again, so I'm going to have to make sure I delete the clean transcript every time.
[2025-07-21 17:00:22] So, for some reason, it's the leading. Uh.
[2025-07-21 17:00:33] I'm sorry. First thing. But, you know, that's fine.
[2025-07-21 17:00:43] Thanks for watching!
[2025-07-21 17:00:54] So I'm going to keep it running in the background while I work real quick because I want to
[2025-07-21 17:01:04] Chuck, if you'll crash, it usually crashes when it's silent. So.
[2025-07-21 17:01:15] Thanks for watching!
[2025-07-21 17:01:25] Thanks for watching!
[2025-07-21 17:01:36] Thanks for watching!
[2025-07-21 17:01:46] Yes, delete the transcript. That's what I need to do. Uh... Here, let me add things for watching here.
[2025-07-21 17:01:57] Thanks for watching!
[2025-07-21 17:02:07] Thanks for watching!
[2025-07-21 17:02:18] There we go. I added the thanks for watching. Now what was I doing? Yeah, clean transcript.
[2025-07-21 17:02:28] That. Oh, stop.
[2025-07-21 17:02:39] or an OS, database, oh nevermind wrong one. When you do
[2025-07-21 17:02:49] port os on api testing it clean file name
[2025-07-21 17:03:10] Clean File Name, there we go. So if we do os.removeCleanFireName, that should remove it just.
[2025-07-21 17:03:21] Okay.
[2025-07-21 17:03:42] I could rename it and just save it, but it's already saved as transcript, so I don't need to save it.
[2025-07-21 17:03:52] Oh yeah, okay. We don't need to save it at all, we could just delete it. Okay, let me run the clean transcript one more time.
--------------------
[2025-07-21 17:04:03] and see if it removes the thanks for watching because that's really bothering me.
[2025-07-21 17:04:13] Perfect. So it doesn't... Yeah, it just ignores the thanks for watching. Let's go! Okay, that'll save so much...
[2025-07-21 17:04:34] for a bit longer. I just want to see how much it still take up if I run it to like, let's say an hour. An hour from now.
[2025-07-21 17:04:45] Thanks for watching!
[2025-07-21 17:04:55] Thanks for watching!
[2025-07-21 17:05:06] Thanks for watching!
[2025-07-21 17:05:16] Thanks for watching!
[2025-07-21 17:05:37] Thanks for watching!
[2025-07-21 17:05:48] Thanks for watching!
[2025-07-21 17:05:58] Thanks for watching!
[2025-07-21 17:06:09] Thanks for watching!
[2025-07-21 17:06:19] Thanks for watching!
[2025-07-21 17:06:30] Thanks for watching!
[2025-07-21 17:06:40] Thanks for watching!
[2025-07-21 17:07:01] Thanks for watching!
[2025-07-21 17:07:12] Thanks for watching!
[2025-07-21 17:07:43] Thanks for watching!
[2025-07-21 17:08:04] Thanks for watching!
[2025-07-21 17:08:46] Thanks for watching!
[2025-07-21 17:08:56] Thanks for watching!
[2025-07-21 17:09:07] Okay, let's see. Oh, that's a lot of thanks for watching. Looks like we had an error, but...
[2025-07-21 17:09:17] Okay, it's been running pretty well. Let me play some Hell Let Loose. I have a
[2025-07-21 17:09:28] It has some cong... it has a lot of communications, so I'll talk and we'll run through it and
[2025-07-21 17:09:39] Oh, it plays out how many.
[2025-07-21 17:09:49] on different building styles and cam machines. Please let me know what you think or if you have any suggestions. Regardless, today's bowl a little upsetting the cocktail.
[2025-07-21 17:10:00] I wasn't careful, I should have scooped those out with a fork instead of trying to pour the jar in. All of the brine is in the stew. The okra is great.
[2025-07-21 17:10:10] I do think are a good addition. I just should not have let all of the Bromance do There's still some
[2025-07-21 17:10:21] In his prison cell in 1943, waiting to be executed for his role in a plot to assassinate Hitler, Bonhoeffer wrote what would become his most haunting
[2025-07-21 17:10:31] observation. Against stupidity, we are defenseless.
[2025-07-21 17:10:41] It wasn't just its context, but its precision. Evil, he noted.
[2025-07-21 17:10:51] always carries within itself the jerk of its own subversion. It creates unease, resistance, eventual breakdown, but stupidity?
[2025-07-21 17:11:02] It believes it's doing good.
[2025-07-21 17:11:42] in the
[2025-07-21 17:11:53] uh Mortain i've ever played mortain ever let's go run it run that shit. Oh server full
[2025-07-21 17:12:03] How about you fill these nuts? Wow, so many new maps.
[2025-07-21 17:12:13] Q is full, motherfucker. No, the fuck it's not. Q is not full.
[2025-07-21 17:12:23] 1111 and 712 is it still listening to me?
[2025-07-21 17:12:33] I don't think it's listening to me. That's pretty bad. Oh, nope.
[2025-07-21 17:12:44] Bye bye.
[2025-07-21 17:12:54] All right, Simon Kueh.
[2025-07-21 17:13:04] Thanks for watching!
[2025-07-21 17:13:14] To three cents, what shall I ever do?
[2025-07-21 17:13:24] Okay. Let's see. Um. Why is my performance so unbelievably shit? Um.
[2025-07-21 17:13:35] Now, Steve Views 100%.
[2025-07-21 17:13:45] Anti-malware service executable. Fuck off here. Studio Code.
[2025-07-21 17:13:55] Hi son, I'm using 43% of my CPU are we dead ass?
[2025-07-21 17:14:05] Huh. Well that sucks.
[2025-07-21 17:14:16] That's why it's so laggy. Alright, well, I think we've proven that if it crashes, they'll continue on.
[2025-07-21 17:14:26] That silence doesn't really affect it. So I think that's good.
[2025-07-21 17:14:36] We'll see how it is to play. If it's shit and ass, I'm just going to stop the program.
[2025-07-21 17:14:46] If it's good, we'll continue. Now I'm just going to be holding five minutes, and it's going to suck, Dick.
[2025-07-21 17:15:07] Thanks for watching!
[2025-07-21 17:15:17] Thank you.
[2025-07-21 17:15:37] please. Okay, that is so laggy.
[2025-07-21 17:15:48] Yeah, I'm going to stop the program.
