[2025-07-20 19:54:48] It's been a bunch of audio. Get some data. This is going to be just from reels. I'm going to get the...
[2025-07-20 19:54:58] uh audio transcriber thing i just want to get a bunch of test data and then i'm going to send it to chadgbt see how much that
[2025-07-20 19:55:09] And then ask it like, hey, which API model would be best for it to make.
[2025-07-20 19:55:19] like calendar date thingies and make csv files and stuff like that so
[2025-07-20 19:55:30] Oh, I forgot to mention basically I'm just gonna scroll through real skit like 10-20 minutes of this stuff. Just get a big...
[2025-07-20 19:55:40] And then, yeah, once in a while I'll pause and I'll say like, you know, Oh, hi man, how you doing? Been a while.
[2025-07-20 19:55:51] I met you in a while. Hey, Donav, how you doing? Uh, I just wanted to ask you, like, what you've been up to. Oh, man, you know, not much.
[2025-07-20 19:56:01] I've been planning an event actually pretty pretty recently. Do you want to come over on the 20th? I'm having my birthday party Oh, so
[2025-07-20 19:56:12] Sure what time what time will it be and where will it be? Oh, you know the 20th of August and it will be at 3 p.m.
[2025-07-20 19:56:22] New work mall we were we're gonna go shopping then maybe go, you know go carding stuff like that
[2025-07-20 19:56:33] If Exxon thought they were the future, they'd be putting them up all over the place. What the f*** is this argument? I'm sorry. If wind turbines worked, where would they be?
[2025-07-20 19:56:43] Turbine! He's here against Luigi because he killed the CEO of United Health Care.
[2025-07-20 19:56:54] He took an American flag and started beating a cop with him over and over again in steps of our Capitol building until that cop died. Trump would
[2025-07-20 19:57:04] No, Trump is seeking the death penalty!
[2025-07-20 19:57:15] Played Mario Bros. Wii with friends, you probably know that having two players ground pound at the same time instantly defeats all of the enemies touching the ground. This technique-
[2025-07-20 19:57:25] Collect 1-ups, complete challenges, and even defeat bosses. But what happens if we try to use this ability on Bowser? And is this effect more powerful if we ground-
[2025-07-20 19:57:36] 4 players instead of 2. Let's find out. As soon as Luigi and I entered the final boss fight, we performed a synchronized ground pound, which pretty much did nothing. But after
[2025-07-20 19:57:46] In two more, we were able to finish the job, which let us hit a button without any enemies in our way. Now, after Bowser entered his second phase, we tried ground pounding again.
[2025-07-20 19:57:57] They did absolutely nothing. Next, I added the toads to see if before Player Grand Pound would have extra power. It doesn't. If you've ever played Mario- This is probab-
[2025-07-20 19:58:07] Thanks for watching!
[2025-07-20 19:58:18] That's better than one mega night. Two mega nights.
[2025-07-20 19:58:28] Yeah, that's right. Two meganites. And let me tell you, do you know what's better than two meganites?
[2025-07-20 19:58:39] Mega Knight. Oh my god! After all that? Yes, go off! You guys know the only thing that's bad? If you're young, your main priority needs to be getting up.
[2025-07-20 19:58:49] Moving in with your friends. I mean just look we got my PC in there his PC in there We're just grinding all day working. We only keep healthy shit in our fridge and every single day that we are literally just out
[2025-07-20 19:59:00] The funny part about it is it is really not that expensive. How many players? 26.1 million. Playing one game at the same time. Yup. You realize you just-
[2025-07-20 19:59:10] concurrent player record right? Really? Yeah, Fortnite used to hold 8. They did? You bet your Riz we did. Galactus event, we had 15.3 million concurrent players.
[2025-07-20 19:59:21] Please prepare that. What were they playing? It's a really popular game on our platform right now called Grow a Garden. Grow a Garden? It's a really fun game.
[2025-07-20 19:59:31] Grow a garden. So let me get this straight. You guys had more players than half of Steam. Wait, what? We're currently playing a game where you just grow a-
[2025-07-20 19:59:42] Yep, that's exactly right. What? How many players? Ah, I'm glad I'm not a party person. Because I'll be going to them parties and just start dropping light flies. It's not even worth the risk.
[2025-07-20 19:59:52] Worry about my safety? Fuck I worry about if I'm gonna get shot? Is it really fun? Is it really a party? I feel like every time I hear they're gonna party, someone either gets shot or someone either gets hurt. Bye! Bye!
[2025-07-20 20:00:03] Hi, hi, what's up? Yeah. Oh, uh, doctor's appointment at 7 p.m. on Thursday.
[2025-07-20 20:00:13] Yeah, okay, okay, I can make that. Alright, cool. See ya. Bye bye.
[2025-07-20 20:00:24] Exam student suddenly raised his hand and claimed he had a stomachache the invigilator let him leave the room to go to the Restroom, but instead of going straight to the toilet the student headed into a stall
[2025-07-20 20:00:34] Earlier, he had an administrative-looking jacket. He put it on, transforming himself into what looked like a school official. Calmly, he strolled into the neighboring classroom, where an exam was also underway.
[2025-07-20 20:00:45] The lady in that  room didn't recognize him and saw the formal outfit. She assumed he was some education department supervisor She nervously greeted him the student fully committed to the act replied
[2025-07-20 20:00:55] No worries. I'm just here to take a look around. He then walked casually around a classroom, pretending to inspect the environment while sneakily glancing at several top students' test papers. Before
[2025-07-20 20:01:06] Bill in character, he even reminded the teacher, please maintain strict discipline in the room. Then he returned to the bathroom, changed back into his school uniform, and went back to his own exam room to con-
[2025-07-20 20:01:16] Now armed with all the answers he needed, unfortunately for him, someone in the other classroom recognized him and reported him. During an exam. And as long as you're doing this in a hurry...
[2025-07-20 20:01:27] Not legally. Excuse me, how am I harassing you? You're harassing me. Go get the permit and you won't have a problem. Okay. What? Where's the permit? Where's the permit?
[2025-07-20 20:01:37] It's the impartment graduate.
[2025-07-20 20:01:48] Thank you.
[2025-07-20 20:01:58] Yeah, there's something interesting could happen if I took a sealed glass jar to the bottom of the ocean. So first I got my jar, and then I went to the bottom of the ocean. My first question was, does the-
[2025-07-20 20:02:09] and yes it does. I almost lost it. People have been asking how I stay stuck at the bottom. I wear a pretty heavy weight belt, but despite that I'm still able to float at the surface by keeping my lung-
[2025-07-20 20:02:19] Don't blow any air out to sink, and the way that it works is that my lungs are compressed to half their size at 33 feet, meaning I am half as buoyant. Having said, I just made a million dollars.
[2025-07-20 20:02:30] We just killed a goblin scientist and I did! Oh my god it was so worth it! It was so worth it! Every ounce of elixir! What's beautiful! We'll go pre-lo-
[2025-07-20 20:02:40] The wind was low, which I've learned. So we're going to risk it and go with an earthquake.
[2025-07-20 20:02:51] Now Tesla's one shot, pre-log again. You gotta go Goblin Gang or that's just another hit. You know what, I'll take it. Bro, why would you not play Goblin Gang? So we'll go with Ice Spirit like this just to distract the Firecracker.
[2025-07-20 20:03:01] Skellige's hopefully can yeah look at that. Oh my gosh like you just you know I'm gonna do firecracker is what I mean Like you know I'm doing that. I'm gonna go earthquake just to slow everything down my firecracker
[2025-07-20 20:03:12] Die, but his scientist dies too. Uh, this is gonna be a little iffy. Let's hopefully snipe out his firecracker. I won't do!
[2025-07-20 20:03:22] He's literally only gotten log damage on my towers by the way, I just want to point that out. And we'll go log as well plus ice spear to counter all the wall breakers, or one wall breaker and a firecracker, but oh my god it's all dead.
[2025-07-20 20:03:33] Only take it long damage this game bro Nothing, but long damage, and we just do this and this everything lines up Log this out so it dies protect our firecracker with his
[2025-07-20 20:03:43] Firecracker shoot! Oh my god, his firecracker is dead. It doesn't mathematically get better. The only damage we took all game was king tower and log damage. I just spent a million elixir to hopefully just kill the goblin.
[2025-07-20 20:03:54] I did! Oh my god it was so worth it! It was so worth it! Remember the company that resurrected the dire wolf from extinction? Well, we've got a crazy update on it. Six months-
[2025-07-20 20:04:04] Okay.

[2025-07-20 20:05:28] Ask me, Daddy B, what was the worst day of your life? This would be in the conversation? It's not like, oh, Evil Valkyrie 1. No, it's not just that. It's the fact that I'm not going to be able to do it.
[2025-07-20 20:05:39] In our group, in our game population of players, 34% of the game voted for Ivo Halker. You shitting me? Hey!
[2025-07-20 20:05:49] I'm gonna go as far as add the 15% from Evil Wizard because you guys are just as sorry sacks as the evil Bob voters. I'm gonna say, it's all those guys that said
[2025-07-20 20:06:00] I made alternate accounts and I voted for Evil Falcon every single one of them. I hope one of your AirPods falls in the toilet. Don't cry hell of a boss fan.

[2025-07-20 20:07:02] Lag down. I was thinking I might replace it with this one. Oh, it's so tough. What are you gonna do? Go write them a shitty diss track?
[2025-07-20 20:07:13] Thank you. Bye.
[2025-07-20 20:07:34] Here, try this. Actually, even you, I can't start with this. Let me start you with this guy, right? No, no, wait, wait, wait. What's up with that one? The PXG Proto.
[2025-07-20 20:07:44] People like to be scum. This guy is not going to take no for an answer. Go ahead.

[2025-07-20 20:08:47] Which push and that electric chain is insane being able to fully counter this push by itself. Next is going up against a very spammy army.
[2025-07-20 20:08:58] with wall breakers and a skeleton valve but because that electric chain can go on forever it cleans everything. Nice we have a giant double prince purge
[2025-07-20 20:09:08] Super satisfying how you can see the electric chain go between the three units constantly stunning them and fully countering this push. Like we have a POKEMON-

[2025-07-20 20:15:47] Now let's see the scoop.
----------------------------------------------

[2025-07-20 21:42:59] Okay, so we're going to do a little quick test. What we're going to do is just say kind of like, Have a

[2025-07-20 21:43:41] But we're gonna have a lot of fun. Again me and Don of are going my name is Victor. And we're also going to.
[2025-07-20 21:43:51] Come back at 7 p.m. and we're gonna start going there at around 8 a.m. So yeah, be ready.
[2025-07-20 21:44:02] Okay, we'll just let that simmer, let that all get written down, and then we will...
-----------------------------------------------
[2025-07-20 21:59:03] Okay, here we go, test number three. So I'm going to talk for like a minute or two and then I'm going to start feeding it some lines.
[2025-07-20 21:59:14] Pretty good. I'm going somewhere this weekend. Oh, where are you going? And can I come with?
[2025-07-20 21:59:24] Yeah, sure. I'm going on a fishing trip. Oh, I just realized something. I'm gonna have to make sure that it can tell the difference between me and you.
[2025-07-20 21:59:35] and somebody else. That's gonna fuckin' suck. Actually...
[2025-07-20 21:59:45] I'll just ignore it and I'll add a little note to self note to sell. Let me write this on a piece of paper.
[2025-07-20 21:59:56] I don't have any paper yet. Those are my passwords.
[2025-07-20 22:00:06] Notebook, perfect. I need to...
[2025-07-20 22:00:27] Res.
[2025-07-20 22:00:37] Let's add like a check system.
[2025-07-20 22:00:48] Like you press the green check buttons if you want to add it to your calendar or an X to not add it to your calendar.
[2025-07-20 22:00:58] So you can kind of tell the difference like, oh, I don't remember being invited to a podcast party in the middle of nowhere. Oh, that must have been my friend talking about it.
[2025-07-20 22:01:09] Yeah. Okay, so that should be enough text. Let's see. I was planning on going on a trip.
[2025-07-20 22:01:19] The 23rd to the 27th which would go to my sister's place in Santa Barbara. I'm just gonna go.
[2025-07-20 22:01:30] teach and stuff, go explore something, it's gonna be pretty warm. The drive is gonna be about five hours and we'll be leaving at around 12, I want to say around 12.
[2025-07-20 22:01:40] around three and then I'll be coming back on the 27th and I'll be coming back at around 5 pm.
[2025-07-20 22:01:51] My sister Anna and I will be just having a grand old time. I'm gonna drive there. It's gonna be fun.
[2025-07-20 22:02:01] Also, I feel like a feature I should add is to find out who's who.
[2025-07-20 22:02:12] Thanks for watching!
[2025-07-20 22:02:22] Hello.
[2025-07-20 22:02:43] know who invited me to who so I just need to have that like I need to figure out how I'm gonna recognize other people's voices because recognize
[2025-07-20 22:02:53] Yeah, just sit down for like 10 hours and train the AI to be like, oh, that's Victor's voice. That's how Victor talks. Um, I'll just lay.
[2025-07-20 22:03:04] as that but it won't be able to tell if somebody else is talking about that with like it won't be able to tell if somebody's just
[2025-07-20 22:03:14] day or if they're inviting me. Anyways, I'm gonna stop the transcription before this costs me a penny. All right, let me uh...
