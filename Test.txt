[2025-07-20 21:59:03] Okay, here we go, test number three. So I'm going to talk for like a minute or two and then I'm going to start feeding it some lines.
[2025-07-20 21:59:14] Pretty good. I'm going somewhere this weekend. Oh, where are you going? And can I come with?
[2025-07-20 21:59:24] Yeah, sure. I'm going on a fishing trip. Oh, I just realized something. I'm gonna have to make sure that it can tell the difference between me and you.
[2025-07-20 21:59:35] and somebody else. That's gonna fuckin' suck. Actually...
[2025-07-20 21:59:45] I'll just ignore it and I'll add a little note to self note to sell. Let me write this on a piece of paper.
[2025-07-20 21:59:56] I don't have any paper yet. Those are my passwords.
[2025-07-20 22:00:06] Notebook, perfect. I need to...
[2025-07-20 22:00:27] Res.
[2025-07-20 22:00:37] Let's add like a check system.
[2025-07-20 22:00:48] Like you press the green check buttons if you want to add it to your calendar or an X to not add it to your calendar.
[2025-07-20 22:00:58] So you can kind of tell the difference like, oh, I don't remember being invited to a podcast party in the middle of nowhere. Oh, that must have been my friend talking about it.
[2025-07-20 22:01:09] Yeah. Okay, so that should be enough text. Let's see. I was planning on going on a trip.
[2025-07-20 22:01:19] The 23rd to the 27th which would go to my sister's place in Santa Barbara. I'm just gonna go.
[2025-07-20 22:01:30] teach and stuff, go explore something, it's gonna be pretty warm. The drive is gonna be about five hours and we'll be leaving at around 12, I want to say around 12.
[2025-07-20 22:01:40] around three and then I'll be coming back on the 27th and I'll be coming back at around 5 pm.
[2025-07-20 22:01:51] My sister Anna and I will be just having a grand old time. I'm gonna drive there. It's gonna be fun.
[2025-07-20 22:02:01] Also, I feel like a feature I should add is to find out who's who.
[2025-07-20 22:02:12] Thanks for watching!
[2025-07-20 22:02:22] Hello.
[2025-07-20 22:02:43] know who invited me to who so I just need to have that like I need to figure out how I'm gonna recognize other people's voices because recognize
[2025-07-20 22:02:53] Yeah, just sit down for like 10 hours and train the AI to be like, oh, that's Victor's voice. That's how Victor talks. Um, I'll just lay.
[2025-07-20 22:03:04] as that but it won't be able to tell if somebody else is talking about that with like it won't be able to tell if somebody's just
[2025-07-20 22:03:14] day or if they're inviting me. Anyways, I'm gonna stop the transcription before this costs me a penny. All right, let me uh...
