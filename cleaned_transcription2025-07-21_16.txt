Pretty good. I'm going somewhere this weekend. where are you going? And can I come with?
sure. I'm going on a fishing trip. I realized something. I'm have to make sure that it can tell the difference between me and you.
and somebody else. That's fuckin' suck...
I'll ignore it and I'll add a little note to self note to sell. write this on a piece of paper.
I don't have any paper yet. Those are my passwords.
Notebook, perfect. I need to...
Res.
Let's add a check system.
you press the green check buttons if you want to add it to your calendar or an X to not add it to your calendar
you can tell the difference I don't remember being invited to a podcast party in the middle of nowhere. that must have been my friend talking about it.
that should be enough text. Let's see. I was planning on going on a trip.
The 23rd to the 27th which would go to my sister's place in Santa Barbara. I'm go.
teach and stuff, go explore something, it's be pretty warm. The drive is be about five hours and we'll be leaving at around 12, I want to say around 12.
around three and then I'll be coming back on the 27th and I'll be coming back at around 5 pm.
My sister Anna and I will be having a grand old time. I'm drive there. It's be fun.
Also, a feature I should add is to find out who's who.
know who invited me to who I need to have that I need to figure out how I'm recognize other people's voices because recognize
sit down for 10 hours and train the AI to be that's Victor's voice. That's how Victor talks. I'll lay.
as that but it won't be able to tell if somebody else is talking about that with it won't be able to tell if somebody's
day or if they're inviting me. I'm stop the transcription before this costs me a penny. All..
