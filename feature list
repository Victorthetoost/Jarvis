add another thread that checks for audio commands like "fact check that" which asks chatgpt to fact check the statement.
add another feature called clip that, whcih saves the last 2 min of audio with the date and time and it's own transcription
    make a front end feature that makes it so that you can look up if someone said that
figure out who is talking and when, and label that in real time so that its easier to tell what is going on.
