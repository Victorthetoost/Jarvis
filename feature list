add another thread that checks for audio commands like "fact check that" which asks chatgpt to fact check the statement.
add another feature called clip that, whcih saves the last 2 min of audio with the date and time and it's own transcription
    make a front end feature that makes it so that you can look up if someone said that
figure out who is talking and when, and label that in real time so that its easier to tell what is going on. 

make a button that when pressed opens up a weekly schedule, where you can input your classes and the times at which they are supposed to be,
    and then the program records everything in those time slots, parses it for events and then makes detailed notes about what you learned and what you shoudl study
    aswell as any homewokr assignments or anythign like that. 

for the main page make a calendar/list of things to do and have the floating text stuff just be the backround.
    start with just the calendar and/or list of to-do items as that is the most important. 

have the gps data, and find out where everything is. so if it says "event at newark mall etc" then it will find the average time from home to that place,
    and also the time it will take to drive from current location. it will also give a "leave by" time which is travel time -5 min
