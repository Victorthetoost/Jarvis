[2025-07-18 20:45:47.663074][Thread-1] Alright, so I think it should work now because it is kind of breaking before on Jupiter and I think that's because the Jupiter notebook can't handle it. I know the writing across the switch works perfectly now. I just got to make sure that it doesn't crash. It also has this weird thing where it's writing to it.
[2025-07-18 20:45:54.945139][Thread-2] Well, it just randomly starts saying, Thanks for watching, thanks for watching you, thanks for watching you, you, thanks for watching, and then it's just blank, and that's kinda freaky me.
[2025-07-18 20:46:00.006340][Thread-1] But, I think, uh...
[2025-07-18 20:46:06.413419][Thread-2] you're just hallucinating uh something so hopefully you thanks for watching you you thanks for watching and then it's just blank and that's kind of freaky me
[2025-07-18 20:46:10.983354][Thread-1] should be good.
[2025-07-18 20:46:18.025881][Thread-2] Yeah I think uh... Okay so I think it works. Hopefully you... Thanks for watching you, you, thanks for watching and then it's just blank and that's kinda freaking me out.
[2025-07-18 20:46:23.383780][Thread-1] on a normal thing not jupiter notebook but like the normal python python
[2025-07-18 20:46:27.855131][Thread-2] I think.

[2025-07-18 21:01:28.860311][Thread-1] There we go recording all right, so it hasn't crashed yet, which is a good sign Thread name no voice detected skipping Transcription so hopefully detects my voice. Oh, I forgot to go to transcription dot py So that way when it starts writing it's not gonna Be weird hopefully any second now texture start appearing and
[2025-07-18 21:03:19.700980][Thread-1] okay so it should be working a lot better now yeah I'm not gonna touch it at all because I think that might have crashed it before so I'm not gonna touch the the transcription you are that txt file at all I think it should be a lot better hopefully um it is say it is a lot slower because the other one used to go like line by line anytime
[2025-07-18 21:03:25.594548][Thread-2] pause it does a new line but in this case I don't know I don't know if it's gonna do that
[2025-07-18 21:03:30.792863][Thread-1] Okay, so the first one worked great. Let's see if...
[2025-07-18 21:03:37.500905][Thread-2] Oh, oh, there we go, there we go, we're going now, we're going now. I don't know. I don't know if it's gonna do that.
