[2025-08-01 11:41:59] Okay, okay, we fixed it. Let's see. Okay, so we have one minute starting now, so 41, I have 42, I'll stop.
[2025-08-01 11:42:10] Let's see if it works. Let me talk about something like I have a birthday party at Newark Mall.
[2025-08-01 11:42:20] ...7pm on Thursday, January 25th, 2026, and I think that Donna will be coming, and me, and uh...
[2025-08-01 11:42:31] and some of my friends. And I need to bring a coat because it will be very cold. Alright, let's see, uh...
[2025-08-01 11:42:41] We'll get there in 45 seconds. Let's see if we'll update that to the CSV.
[2025-08-01 11:42:52] Coming in on 50 seconds, should be soon.
[2025-08-01 11:43:03] Okay, so it crashed. Right the way you saw it.
[2025-08-01 11:43:13] So did it crash? Or is it fine?
[2025-08-01 11:43:34] What is it now? Oh... Okay, so the-
[2025-08-01 11:43:45] Okay, I've got the CSV. Okay.
[2025-08-01 11:46:37] Okay, here we go. Test number five or six or seven or something like that. I basically turned the transcription method into
[2025-08-01 11:46:47] Transcription to CSV.
[2025-08-01 11:46:58] I'm inviting you to my birthday party on January 26th. It's gonna be on 2026.
[2025-08-01 11:47:08] I'm going to Newark Mall, who's coming, it's gonna be Anais, Donneth, some other friends, my brother, and you're gonna have to bring a coat.
[2025-08-01 11:47:29] Transformers, and also I've been working on this project and I might need some help with it, but we'll see.
[2025-08-01 11:47:40] Alright.
[2025-08-01 11:47:50] Did it crash? Did it work?
[2025-08-01 11:48:01] Because, what did it not like? It didn't like output file? Why did it not like output file?
[2025-08-01 11:48:11] Let me just...what? Why did I write down the part?
[2025-08-01 11:48:22] Thanks for watching!
[2025-08-01 11:48:32] Thanks for watching!
[2025-08-01 11:48:43] Right. Why did it not like output file? And the software ruined.
[2025-08-01 11:48:53] Thank you for watching!
[2025-08-01 11:49:04] I expected 10 fields in line 3 saw 11.
[2025-08-01 11:49:14] Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute.
[2025-08-01 11:49:25] Thanks for watching!
[2025-08-01 11:49:35] Alright, I'm just gonna pause this.
[2025-08-01 15:17:23] Alright, okay, so it seems to have worked. Let's see, okay. So if I...
[2025-08-01 15:17:34] I'm having a birthday party on August 2nd, 2029.
